**Tips for Making it Work:**

* **Batch similar tasks:**  Group errands, meal prep, or similar work tasks to maximize efficiency.

* **Utilize technology:**  Use online calendars, to-do lists, and productivity apps to stay organized.
* **Communicate with your family:**  Explain the schedule and why it's important. Get their input and make adjustments as needed.
* **Be flexible!**  Things will come up, and it's okay to deviate from the schedule sometimes. The goal is to create a framework that supports your well-being and allows you to manage your multiple roles effectively.
* **Outsource if possible:**  Consider outsourcing tasks like cleaning, grocery delivery, or yard work if your budget allows.
* **Schedule self-care like any other appointment:** Treat self-care as a non-negotiable priority and schedule it into your calendar.
* **Don't strive for perfection:** Some days will be better than others.  Focus on progress, not perfection.
