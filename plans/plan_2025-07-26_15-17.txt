This is a sample schedule, and you'll need to adapt it based on your family's needs, work hours, and personal preferences.  The key is to block out time and stick to it as much as possible.  Flexibility is important, but having a framework helps maintain balance.

**Weekday Schedule:**

* **6:00 AM - 7:00 AM:  Self-Care/Me Time:**  Wake up before everyone else.  Use this time for exercise, meditation, journaling, or simply enjoying a quiet cup of coffee.
* **7:00 AM - 8:00 AM: Family Time:**  Breakfast with family, get kids ready for school/daycare.
* **8:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Work Block:** This is a large block, but it can be broken down further depending on your work schedule.  Include short breaks throughout the day for lunch and a quick walk or stretch.
    * **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break:**  Try to step away from your workspace if possible.
* **5:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Family Time:**  Dinner preparation, family dinner, help with homework, after-school activities.
* **7:00 PM - 8:00 PM: Family Time/Wind Down:** Bath time for kids, bedtime stories, quiet playtime.
* **8:00 PM - 9:00 PM: Self-Care/Me Time:**  Relaxing activity like reading, a bath, or catching up with a friend.
* **9:00 PM - 10:00 PM: Prepare for the next day/Wind Down:** Pack lunches, lay out clothes, quick tidy-up.
* **10:00 PM: Bedtime:**  Aim for consistent sleep.

**Weekend Schedule:**

* **Morning:** Family Time:  Brunch, outdoor activities, errands, or a special family project.
* **Afternoon:** Flexible Time: This could be a mix of family time, personal errands, or some dedicated work time if needed. Try to schedule at least one longer block for focused self-care or a hobby.
* **Evening:** Family Time/Wind Down:  Similar to weekdays, but perhaps with a movie night or game night.


**Tips for Success:**

* **Batch similar tasks:**  Combine errands, cook multiple meals at once, or tackle similar work tasks together.
* **Use a planner or calendar:**  Digital or paper, whatever works for you.  Schedule everything, including self-care.
* **Communicate with your family:**  Let everyone know the schedule and expectations.
* **Be flexible:**  Life happens.  Don't be afraid to adjust the schedule when needed.
* **Prioritize:**  Identify your most important tasks for each day and focus on those first.
* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:**  From your partner, family, friends, or even professional help if needed.
* **Outsource where possible:**  Grocery delivery, cleaning service, etc. can free up valuable time.
* **Protect your self-care time:**  This isn't selfish; it's essential for your well-being and your ability to manage everything else.


Remember, finding the right balance takes time and experimentation.  Start with a basic schedule and adjust it based on what works for you and your family.  The most important thing is to be intentional about how you spend your time and prioritize your well-being along with the needs of your family.
